TITLE: DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF SALES & EXPENSES
  This project focuses on analyzing a small business dataset containing three key variables: Category, Sales, and Expenses. The goal of the project is to understand business performance by visualizing these values using different chart types. The dataset is analyzed using python, and several visualizations are generated to extract meaningful isights.
  Tools Uses:
     . Python
     . Pandas for data handling.
     .Matplotlib for visualizations
     .Jupyter Notebook for analysis workflow
   Purpose of the Project:
      . To practice data analysis basics.
      . To generate and understand different chart types.
      . To gain hands-on experience in Python data visualization.
      . To interpret insights from numerical data.
    Conclusion:
        This project demonstrates how simple datasets can be analyzed and visualized to extract useful information. The visual charts show clear differences between categories and help understand sales trends, cost distribution, and correlations.
